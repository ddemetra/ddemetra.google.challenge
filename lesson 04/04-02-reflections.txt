1. Delete line and combine the bold and italic in one for the html
2. Yes I am good at mocking the designs. 
3. I couldn't figure it out how to make the margins look tight. I wanted to try and see if I could figure it out. I had a hard time to understand the difference between <em> and <i> or <b> and <strong>. I couldn't see the difference. 
4. I try not to get intimidated by the coding. So yes, the warmups helped to overcome the challenges.
